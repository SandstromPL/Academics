This folder contains 2 files for respective questions in lab 4 assigment of Compiler Design CSL302.

Q1:
Implemented head, tail, cat and cp linux command using lex.

Q2:
It tells whether given file drectory or folder directory path is valid or not.

To run lex file first we need to do : lex <filename> , which will generate lex.yy.c file.
Then we use gcc lex.yy.c -o <output> to compile it and get a executalbe file <ouptput> and finally run it 
./<outout>.

**NOTE** : I have used google search, gfg, gemini 2.5 to understand and modify my code.
