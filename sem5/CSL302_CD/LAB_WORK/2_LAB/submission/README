This folder contains two files : t3_tokens.l and t4_wc.l (lex file)

Use lex <filename> which generates lex.yy.c file.
Use gcc lex.yy.c -o <outName> to compile it and generate executable file with name <outName> and do ./<outName> to run it.

t3_tokens.l : 
generated C file can identify name, phone number, credit card number, DOB and email with correct format as given in assignment and 
for any incorrect format it outputs nothing.

t4_wc.l :
generated C file performs same operation as wc command to print number of lines, words and characters in any given file ,
used yyin for file operations.

**Took help of google search and ChatGPT to learn how to write correct rules and about yyin for file operations. **
