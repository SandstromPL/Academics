From the output:

Total time: 23

CPU Busy: 10 → 43.48% utilization

I/O Busy: 12 → 52.17% utilization

This causes a big drop in CPU utilization and an increase in total execution time. 
While a process is waiting for I/O, CPU stays idle even if other processes are ready. 
This is inefficient for multitasking but may be seen in batch systems where context switching is expensive.
